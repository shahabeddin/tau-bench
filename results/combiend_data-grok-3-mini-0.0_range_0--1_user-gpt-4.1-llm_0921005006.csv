Agent: Sure, let me check that for you. The order was sent to 943 Maple Drive, Suite 356, Chicago, IL, 60621. The tracking number is 840887978435.

User: Thank you. Is the order still in transit?

Agent: Yes, the order is still in transit and should arrive soon.

User: Also, I ordered a tablet. Can you check the storage capacity for me?

Agent: The tablet you ordered has a storage capacity of 32GB.

User: I want to change my default address to my daughter's address so I don't have to change it every time I order something for her.

Agent: I have updated your default address to 943 Maple Drive, Suite 356, Chicago, IL, 60621.

User: Thanks. Can we chat for a bit? I'm feeling a bit lonely.

Agent: Of course, I'm here to chat. How's the weather in Denver?
