Also, for order #W2702727, I need to change the shipping address to 1234 Elm St, Springfield, IL, 62701, and confirm the total price after the change.\n\nAgent: Hello Yusuf, I understand your concerns. Let me check the status of your orders. Order #W2702727 is pending due to a delay in stock availability, and order #W8268610 is pending due to a payment verification issue. Unfortunately, I cannot guarantee that order #W8268610 will be processed within 5 days.
